Problem Solver Platform is a real-world MERN stack application designed to streamline complaint registration, assignment, and resolution. The platform supports OTP-based authentication, role-based dashboards (Admin, Sub-Admin, Solver, User), real-time notifications using Socket.IO, and secure complaint lifecycle management.

Key highlights include category-based complaint routing, admin-controlled role management, OTP verification during signup, automated cleanup of resolved complaints, and export functionality (PDF & Excel) for reporting and audit purposes.
